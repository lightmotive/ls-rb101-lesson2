# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:
# No need to code here, just practice writing logic out in English.

# PROBLEM: a method that returns the sum of two integers
# CASUAL: Given two integers, calculate the sum
# PSEUDOCODE: CALCULATE the sum of number1 and number2

# PROBLEM: a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
# CASUAL:
# Given an array of strings
#
# Create a new empty string
#
# Iterate through the array of strings
# - append each string to the empty string
# ***
# PSEUDOCODE:
# START
#
# READ string_array
# SET concatenated_strings to new string
#
# FOR each string in string_array
#   SET concatenated_strings to concatenated_strings plus string
# ENDFOR
#
# END

# PROBLEM: a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
# CASUAL:
# Given an array of integers
#
# Create an empty array called every_second_integer
#
# Iterate through integers with index
# - If index is odd
#   - Append the current integer to every_second_integer
# ***
# PSEUDOCODE:
# START
#
# READ array of integers into integers
# SET every_second_integer to an empty array
#
# FOR each (integer, index) in integers
#   IF index is odd
#     APPEND integer to every_second_integer
#   ENDIF
