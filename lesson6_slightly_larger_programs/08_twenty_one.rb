# P1: Understand the problem
# With a player and a dealer, deal cards from a standard 52-card deck.
# - Start with 2 cards face up for player, and 1 up/1 down for the dealer.
# Player goes first: they can hit as long as they don't bust (exceed 21),
# or stay.
# Dealer goes second if player doesn't bust.
# - Dealer (computer) play rules:
#   - Hit until value is >= 17.
# The winner is the player closest to 21, or the one who doesn't bust.

# P2: Examples/Test Cases
# N/A for now.

# P3: Data Structure
# ** Cards **
# Array of hashes; one hash for each card; hash includes:
# - suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)
# - value (2-10, j, q, k, ace)

# P4: Algorithm
# ** Calculate hand value **
# Sum all values as follows:
# - 2-10: face value
# - Jack, Queen, King: 10
# - Ace: depends on hand value...
#   - If hand value is <= 21 when ace is 11, then ace is 11.
#   - Otherwise, aces are worth 1.
